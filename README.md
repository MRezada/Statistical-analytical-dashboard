Excel Statistical Dashboard – Caspian Food Industries
This project contains the first statistical dashboard I developed for Caspian Food Industries using Microsoft Excel.
As a Data Scientist at the company, my main objective was to transform raw operational data into clear, visual, and data-driven insights that can support better decision-making.

Features
Fully interactive dashboard built in Excel

Visual representation of key metrics and performance indicators

Designed for non-technical stakeholders to easily interpret data

Custom charts, slicers, and conditional formatting for better usability

Purpose
This dashboard marks the company’s first step towards a data-driven culture, where decisions are backed by measurable facts rather than assumptions.
